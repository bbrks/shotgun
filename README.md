Take the shotgun approach to your terminal. :boom:

## Installation/Updating

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/bbrks/shotgun
```

## Why?

Imagine you're working on a system with 20, 50, 100, or more microservices, all in separate repositories.
How do you update them all at once? Easy.

```sh
$ shotgun git pull
```

What about removing all local changes and syncing with the remote master branches?

```sh
$ shotgun 'git fetch origin; git reset --hard origin/master; git clean -f'
```

Not convinced yet? See just how fast running commands in parallel vs. sequentially actually is:
